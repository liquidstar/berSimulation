# Module documentation
---
Feels like a waste of time to be honest. Should contribute sufficiently to the throroughness of the project though. If I can document the functionality of my code then I can test it adequately. I have the full ability to half-ass and get out alright. But I'd rather get it right.

##### Update 19/06/2020
Documentation is a bitch as expected. Then again what am I complaining about, being solely responsible for 100% of the commits? Project security demands constant pushing to server. It might be nice to not have to contribute everything.
