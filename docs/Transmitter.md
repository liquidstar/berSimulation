# Transmitter()

Currently working on it so chill.
Broad strokes:
- Takes Serial Data
- Converts to Parallel
- Maps to symbol alphabet
- Add virtual carriers
- IFFT each sample vector

Mapping means to an actual sampled sinusoid, and symbol interval will fix subcarrier spacing ... yay. :cold_sweat: Looks like I might need some LaTeX math to help me dance along.
